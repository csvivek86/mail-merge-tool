# Session State Widget Key Conflict Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was encountering Streamlit session state errors due to attempting to modify session state keys that were already associated with active widgets (specifically the `email_template_quill` key).

## Root Cause
- The `update_current_templates()` function was trying to access `st.session_state.get('email_template_quill', '')` directly
- Debug logging was also trying to access the widget session state key directly
- Streamlit throws errors when you try to modify session state keys that are being used by active widgets

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated `update_current_templates()` function** (line ~2218):
   - Changed from accessing `st.session_state.get('email_template_quill', '')`
   - Now uses `st.session_state.get('current_email_content', '')` instead
   - This maintains the separation between widget keys and our custom session state keys

2. **Fixed debug logging** (line ~1465):
   - Changed from `st.session_state.get('email_template_quill', 'NOT FOUND')`
   - Now uses `st.session_state.get('current_email_content', 'NOT FOUND')`
   - Maintains consistent debugging without accessing widget keys

## Key Architecture
- **Widget session state**: `email_template_quill` (managed by Streamlit widget)
- **Custom session state**: `current_email_content` (managed by our code)
- **Template storage**: `current_email_template` (contains processed template data)

## Files Modified
- `streamlit_app.py`: Fixed session state key conflicts in multiple functions

## Validation
- ✅ App compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ No more session state widget key conflicts
- ✅ Email template content flow maintained through proper session state keys

## Impact
- Resolves Streamlit session state errors that were preventing normal app operation
- Maintains the existing functionality for email template editing and mail merge
- Preserves the debugging capabilities with corrected session state access

This fix ensures the app can run without encountering the session state modification errors while maintaining all existing functionality.
